# 🔐 Security Policy for BB Toolkit

Welcome to the **BB Toolkit** repository. Your security is important to us, and we take secure development practices seriously. This document outlines the security practices, disclosure guidelines, and repository protections we follow.

---

## 🔧 Branch Protection Rules (GitHub)

We enforce the following branch protection rules on the `main` branch:

- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require linear history (no merge commits)
- ✅ Require review from Code Owners
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Block force pushes
- ✅ Restrict deletions
- 🛑 *Recommended:* Require signed commits *(optional for solo devs)*

---

## 📦 Code Scanning

We support integration with CodeQL or other static analysis tools. You can:

1. Enable GitHub Advanced Security on the repo
2. Add a `codeql.yml` workflow to scan for vulnerabilities
3. Enforce: `Require code scanning results before merging`

---

## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repo:

- Please **do not** open an issue.
- Email us at: `security@yourdomain.com`
- Or open a confidential discussion (if enabled).

---

## 🔐 Recommended Local Developer Setup

We recommend using:

- GPG or SSH commit signing
- Pre-commit hooks to lint or scan files
- Keeping dependencies updated with tools like `pip-review`, `brew upgrade`, or `nuclei -update-templates`

---

## 👨‍💻 Contributors

Security is a shared responsibility. Please:

- Keep your GitHub account secure
- Enable 2FA on your GitHub account
- Don’t push secrets or tokens — use `.env` and `.gitignore`

---

## 🤖 Future CI/CD Plans (Optional)

We may later integrate workflows for:

- Linting
- Unit testing
- Static Analysis (SAST)
